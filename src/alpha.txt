Give a dynamic-programming algorithm for the activity-selection problem, based on the recurrence (16.3). Have your algorithm compute the sizes c[i, j] as defined above and also produce the maximum-size subset A of activities. Assume that the inputs have been sorted as in equation (16.1). Compare the running time of your solution to the running time of GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR.
